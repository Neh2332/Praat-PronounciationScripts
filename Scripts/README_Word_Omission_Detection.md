## Purpose

This Praat script aims to automatically detect potential instances where a user may have omitted words or significant speech segments when compared to a reference audio recording of the same utterance. It does this by analyzing and comparing the number of detected speech chunks and the overall duration of both recordings.

## How it Works

1.  **Input Selection:**
    *   The script first prompts the user to select the **Reference** audio file (representing the correct pronunciation).
    *   It then prompts the user to select the **User** audio file (the pronunciation to be evaluated).
    *   It reads both files into Praat `Sound` objects.

2.  **Reference Audio Analysis:**
    *   Calculates the total duration of the reference `Sound` object (`ref_duration`).
    *   Creates a `TextGrid` object from the reference sound using the `To TextGrid (silences)` command. This command segments the audio into intervals labeled "silent" or "sounding" based on intensity and timing parameters (specifically: pitch floor 100 Hz, silence threshold -25 dB, min silent duration 0.1s, min sounding duration 0.05s).
    *   Iterates through all intervals in the first tier of the reference `TextGrid`.
    *   Counts the number of intervals labeled "sounding" and stores this count in `ref_speech_segments`. This count serves as an approximation of the number of distinct speech chunks (words/syllables) in the reference.

3.  **User Audio Analysis:**
    *   Performs the identical analysis steps as for the reference audio, but on the user's `Sound` object.
    *   Calculates `user_duration`.
    *   Creates a `user_textgrid` using the same `To TextGrid (silences)` parameters.
    *   Counts the number of "sounding" intervals in the user's TextGrid and stores it in `user_speech_segments`.

4.  **Comparison and Detection Logic:**
    *   Calculates the `duration_ratio` by dividing the `user_duration` by the `ref_duration` (handles the case where `ref_duration` might be zero). A ratio < 1 indicates the user recording is shorter.
    *   Checks for the **omission condition**: Omission is considered likely (`word_omissions_likely` is set to true/non-zero) **if and only if** *both* of the following are true:
        *   The user has fewer speech segments than the reference (`user_speech_segments < ref_speech_segments`).
        *   The user's recording is significantly shorter than the reference (`duration_ratio < 0.9`). The 0.9 threshold means the user's recording is less than 90% of the reference length.

5.  **Output:**
    *   Clears the Praat Info window.
    *   Displays the names of the files being compared.
    *   Shows the calculated durations, duration ratio, and speech segment counts for both reference and user.
    *   Prints a final "DETECTION ASSESSMENT" indicating whether word omissions are "LIKELY Detected" or "NOT Detected".
    *   Provides reasoning based on whether the two conditions (fewer segments AND significantly shorter duration) were met, showing the specific values.
    *   Includes notes about the estimation nature of the analysis and its dependency on parameters and recording quality.

6.  **Cleanup:**
    *   Removes the temporary `Sound` and `TextGrid` objects created during the analysis from the Praat object list.
